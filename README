The mentioned code is in TL-Verilog. The reason to use TL-Verilog instead of Verilog/VHDL is that the structuring of pipelining blocks is alot efficient to code and debug in TL-Verilog.

Step 1: Open link: https://myth1.makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fstevehoover%2FRISC-V_MYTH_Workshop%2Fmaster%2Frisc-v_shell.tlv
Step 2: Copy the code in the script file
Step 3: The Waveform tab would show the expected outcome and Diagram would fetch the circuit visualization
